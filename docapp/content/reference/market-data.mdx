# Market Data

Leo's Stock aggregates data from multiple sources to provide a holistic view of the market.

## Data Sources

### Yahoo Finance
We use the `yfinance` library to fetch historical price data and real-time quotes. This includes:
- OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
- Fundamental data (Balance Sheet, Income Statement)

### Reddit & Social Media
The `ExData` service scrapes discussions from subreddits like `r/wallstreetbets`, `r/stocks`, and `r/investing` to gauge retail investor sentiment.

## Data Storage

Data is stored in a MongoDB database for flexibility and scalability.

- **`stock_prices`**: Historical price data.
- **`sentiment_data`**: Processed sentiment scores from social media posts.
- **`fundamental_data`**: Financial ratios and reports.

## Accessing Data

You can access the data via the internal API or directly through the database.

```python
from db.mongodb import get_db

db = get_db()
prices = db.stock_prices.find({'symbol': 'AAPL'})
```
