# Trading Strategies

Leo's Stock employs a multi-faceted approach to trading, combining technical and fundamental analysis with AI.

## AI Models

### LSTM Price Prediction
We utilize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future stock price movements based on historical sequences. The model is trained on years of daily price data.

- **Input**: 60-day window of OHLCV data.
- **Output**: Predicted closing price for the next day.

### Sentiment Analysis
Our sentiment analysis module uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze social media posts.

- **Model**: Fine-tuned Transformer models (e.g., BERT/RoBERTa) or XGBoost classifiers.
- **Features**: Text content, upvotes, comment count.
- **Output**: Sentiment score (Bullish/Bearish).

## Strategy Execution

The `Agent` service evaluates signals from both models:

1. **Signal Generation**:
   - If LSTM predicts price > threshold AND Sentiment is Bullish -> **BUY**
   - If LSTM predicts price < threshold AND Sentiment is Bearish -> **SELL**

2. **Risk Management**:
   - Stop-loss and Take-profit levels are automatically calculated.
   - Position sizing is based on portfolio volatility.
